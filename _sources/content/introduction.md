# Introduction
*Cerberus* will allow you to analyze combinatorial CRISPR screens. The input file needs to be a read count table.
```{note}
# Basic requirements:
- read count table
- set up with 2 guide casettes at maximum
- guide identifiers (labelled as described here)
- gene identifiers
- read counts for an library / early time point
- read counts for at least one or more end timepoints
```

## For which data 
```{dropdown} Dataset formats
fixed pair
asymmetric: query genes vs. gene set
asymmetric: 2 different gene sets vs. each other
symmetric multiplexed: same gene sets all by all
```
## Cerberus aims
Provide you with suitable easy to use methods to analyze your data
