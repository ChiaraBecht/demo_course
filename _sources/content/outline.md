# Outline
## Introduction
- Aim: what can users expect to do with Cerberus
- Pre-Requisites: executing commands with the command line, linux or OS system
- link the preprint/publication
- link the Cerberus github repo and CeRberus github repo
## How to install Cerberus
use the following helpers to demonstrate how to install
- pictures
- code cells 
## Gettings Started
### verify installation
- i am unsure of how to do that (but would be very helpful)
### Module overview
- work with pictures or slides (can be more extensive than the figures shown in the paper)
### Parameter Settings Deep Dive
- table to list and explain all parameters
- use elements that show specific effect of a chosen Parameter
### Data Formatting
- guide annotation requirements
### Sample Sheet Generation / Codebook
that could be a table explaining every paramter
### Demo Run
Jupyter notebook that shows Cerberus Runs for a small test dataset using various module-paramter combinations.
  - Jupyter Notebook (how can i view QC plots?) that can be run interactively
  - for the multi run version maybe screenshots
